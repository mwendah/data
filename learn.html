                <h3>INTRO</h3>
                <p>
                    Contaminants such as dust, dirt, clothing or skin particles, zinc and metal fibers can collect on your servers, computers, and cabling. Another contaminant to consider are particles released as belts within the cooling system breakdown. Up to 80% of particles are tracked into the data center on the soles of shoes, so reducing foot traffic in these areas is a good preventative measure. 
While these particles are often missed by the human eye due to being airborne, they collect over time and can cause a spike in hardware temperature. Temperature increases can cause device failure on a massive scale, resulting in downtime and data loss.
In addition to causing damage to the hardware itself, dirty or dusty data centers are a fire hazard. Dust buildup combined with static electricity has the potential to start a fire resulting in the loss of a business entirely.

                <h3>What are the risks of a dirty data center?</h3>
                <p>
                    The average cost of downtime for a larger company is $9000 per minute, often resulting in a cost of over $900,000 for a single event. 
                    While the cost of repairing or replacing equipment may only equate to a small portion of this cost, the losses for end user and IT productivity can be much higher.
                    Particles collecting on cabling, ports and hardware can also create interference, slowing down productivity and inhibiting communication. Disorganized cabling, or cables in contact with power cords can also create an environment for interference resulting in slower connectivity speeds and communication disruption.

                <h3>What Could Happen if a Data Centre is Not Regularly Cleaned? </h3>
                <p>
                    There are many risks to not cleaning your data centre regularly. Dust particles can potentially interfere with equipment causing a fault that leads to data losses. As well as data losses, debris or particles of dust can damage your data centre’s hardware. If you’re fortunate it may be a small problem that can be fixed. However, without a proper cleaning routine, an issue could require an expensive repair or lead to the equipment needing a complete replacement.
                    Over time, particles can build up in your data centre which affects the effectiveness of cooling units and air conditioning systems in particular. When debris is allowed to collect in your data centre, all your equipment is impacted. To optimise your data centre’s functionality, you must clean the environment thoroughly and regularly.

                <h3>How Often Should a Data Centre be Cleaned?</h3>
                <p>
                    You should comprehensively clean your data centre every three months. This is what data centre experts recommend based on years of industry experience and expertise. Establishing this routine reduces the risk of data losses, unplanned downtime, and extreme hazards such as fires. Alongside this routine, dusting and vacuuming should take place on an ad hoc basis when needed.
                    Looking after your data centre is essential as a business owner. Cleaning your data centre regularly ensures that your mission-critical equipment continues at peak performance, the environment is hygienic, and safety risks are reduced.

                <h3>Who should be responsible for cleaning the data center?</h3>
                <p>
                    Cleaning your data center is not the same as cleaning the rest of the workplace. You should not have your janitorial staff entering or cleaning these spaces. 
For safety purposes and your peace of mind, hire professionals to clean your data center. People who have the training, experience and understand which products are safe to use and how to move around the space without disrupting any of the cabling or hardware.
